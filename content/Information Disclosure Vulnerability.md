### Introduction :
is when a website unintentionally reveals sensitive information to its users

### Testing :

#### Test 1  ( trying to access through robots.txt file ):
For every website there is a file called **robots.txt** ( not necessarily for every website ) which tells the search engines what not to display to the users
It can be accessed by somewhat typing : `example.com/home/robots.txt`

`Note : make sure to be on the main page`

Ex :
![[IDOR 1.png]]
we can see here that `/backup` file is hidden from all users
So try to load that file like this :


##### If Security is bad it will show up :
![[IDOR 2.png]]


and we find another file so try to open it like this :
![[IDOR 3.png]]
and we see that we can actually access the code which is written in **Java** and contains a lot of valuable information and we can also see that the website is using **PostgreSQL** 

**NOTE : try to read the code to see what's going on or copy paste to ChatGPT**


But this is not showing all the accessible files so we can use a tool to discover hidden files
