#### Requirement :
1. The URL should look something like this :
![[LFI_1.png]]
ie. It should have a parameter load a page, For example here the parameter ***?pages*** is loading a file called ***include.php***

2. If you remove the parameter and try to load the file directly then this type of error should come :
![[LFI_3.png]]
By this you can get to know how many directories are present between the current page and the root. For example here there are 5 directories

you should know the basics of Linux to go further : [[Basics of Linux]]

#### Exploit :
To get access to the `/etc/passwd` file you need go back to the root directory by using the `../` 
(In this case we went 5 directories back ) :
![[LFI_2.png]]

Some other Sensitive files to access include :
- `/proc/self/environ`
- `/var/log/auth.log`
- `/var/log/apache2/access.log`

#### Gaining Reverse Shell access through netcat :
using the `/proc/self/environ` file which tells us about the information of the environment
( Ex : Browser ). We can use this to run netcat commands through Burp Suite proxy
